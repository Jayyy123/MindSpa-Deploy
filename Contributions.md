## **Naming Conventions** 

Please make use of the camel case naming convention when contributing code to this project. This means that variables ( including compound words ), classes and functions should be written in camel case, with the first word lowercase and each subsequent word capitalized. For example:

```js
# Correct
let passwordUtils = require('../lib/passwordUtils');
function getProduct()

# Wrong
let password_Utils = require('../lib/passwordUtils');
function Get_product()
```

The only expection to this rule should be in the definition of columns which have a compound name in a database model. In this case, make use of the snake case naming convention <br>
For example: 

```js
const {Sequelize, DataTypes} = require('sequelize')
const sequelize = new Sequelize()

const transaction = sequelize.define('transaction', {
    ðŸ‘‰ bank_account: {
        type : DataTypes.INTEGER
    },

     ðŸ‘‰ transaction_amount: {
        type : DataTypes.INTEGER
    }
})
```

This naming convention aids in the consistency and readability of our code.
